## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass for styling
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript for form validation and local storage handling

### What I Learned

It was a pleasure working with the DOM and storing data in local storage. I learned how to retrieve data using the DOMContentLoaded event, which was new to me. This project deepened my understanding of handling user input dynamically.

### Continued Development

In the future, I plan to explore how to send emails to users who submit their information, adding more functionality to the form.

### Useful Resources
